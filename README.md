# Multivariate-Adaptive-Regression-Splines
This project, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines or, MARS is built on the model by Jerome Friedman's paper in 1991. The model is an algorithm that automatically creates a piecewise linear model which provides an intuitive stepping block into nonlinearity after grasping the concept of multiple linear regression. Various supporting functions, such as predict and anova, have also been provided to make this algorithm much more useful to the user, with an example test case as well.
